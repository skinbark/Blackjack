Blackjack version 0.01 by David G Brown <dgbrown3070@gmail.com>

Blackjack is a simple version of the popular card game written in Java.
You start with $1000. You may place a bet on each hand of anywhere 
from $5 to $100. Click on the Increase or Decrease buttons to adjust the
amount of the bet. Then click on the New Hand button. You and the dealer 
will each receive two cards. You can then request a Hit or you may Stand, 
Surrender or Double down. If you have two of the same cards you can also 
Split. If you get a Blackjack you automatically win the hand. After you 
have won or lost the hand you can adjust the amount of your bet. Then you 
click on New Hand to start another round.
