Blackjack version 0.01 by David G Brown <dgbrown3070@gmail.com>

Blackjack is a simple version of the popular card game written in Java.
The player begins with $1000. He may place a bet on each hand of anywhere 
from $5 to $100. Click on the Increase or Decrease buttons to adjust the
amount of the bet. Then click on the New Hand button. The player and the
dealer will each receive two cards. The player can then request a Hit or
he may Stand, Surrender or Double down. If he has two of the same cards he
can also Split. If he gets a Blackjack he automatically wins the hand.
After he has won or lost the hand he can adjust the amount of his bet. Then
he clicks on New Hand to start another round.
